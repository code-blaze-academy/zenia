MOD Project Statement of Work (SOW)
Project Code: MOD
Project Overview:
The MOD project aims to develop an AI-powered CAD modeling tool that allows users to 
create and manipulate 3D models through audio feedback. The tool will enable users to 
generate basic geometric shapes (sphere, cube, rectangular box, cone) and perform 
advanced modifications such as cutting holes, changing hole shapes, creating chamfers, 
rounding edges, and shelling out material. The AI will provide feedback similar to PTC 
Creo’s features, facilitating a seamless and intuitive design process. 
Project Goals:
1. 1. Develop an AI-powered CAD modeling tool capable of creating basic geometric 
shapes. 
2. 1. Enable the AI to perform advanced modifications on these shapes through audio 
feedback. 
3. 1. Provide a user-friendly interface for voice commands and feedback. 
4. 1. Ensure high precision and accuracy in model creation and modifications. 
5. 1. Implement features for cutting holes, changing hole shapes, creating chamfers, 
rounding edges, and shelling out material. 
6. 1. Allow users to easily identify and select edges for modifications by assigning numbers 
to each edge. 
Key Features:
7. 1. Basic Shape Creation: Ability to create spheres, cubes, rectangular boxes, and cones. 
8. 1. Hole Modification: Cut holes through models and change hole shapes to squares, 
triangles, circles, or various custom shapes. 
9. 1. Edge Modifications: Create chamfers and round edges, with each edge assigned a 
unique number for easy selection. 
10. 1. Shelling Out Material: Hollow out the inside of a model while maintaining the outer 
shell. 
11. 1. Audio Feedback: Provide real-time audio feedback and guidance to users during the 
modeling process. 
12. 1. User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive interface that supports voice commands 
for all operations. 
Development Phases:
Phase 1: Initial concept design and requirements gathering; Market research and user 
feedback analysis. 
Phase 2: Development of AI algorithms for basic shape creation; Integration of voice 
command functionality. 
Phase 3: Implementation of advanced shape modification features (hole cutting, shape 
changing); Development of edge modification features (chamfers, rounding). 
Phase 4: Shelling out material functionality; Refinement of audio feedback system. 
Phase 5: User interface design and development; Final testing and bug fixes. 
Phase 6: Launch preparation and marketing; Official tool release. 
Phase 7: Post-launch support and updates.
